Accelerated
=============

Accelerated is a collision prediction library for Java. The main advantage are:
	- it is lightweight
    - fast
    - collisions are detected before they happen
	- objects can move at high speeds without tunelling problems

You can use already predefined collision shapes for: Sphere, Plane, Line, Terrain.. or define your own.

Each shape has a position, velocity and an acceleration.
